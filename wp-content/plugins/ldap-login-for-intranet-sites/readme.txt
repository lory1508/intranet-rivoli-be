**What is Kerberos/NTLM Single Sign On (SSO)**

Effortlessly enable Single Sign-On (SSO) within your Active Directory-secured intranet using [Kerberos/NTLM authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/ntlm-kerberos-authentication-mechanism). Enjoy passwordless login for domain-joined machines and enhanced security through restricted external access. With cross-platform compatibility, [Kerberos authentication across Windows](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-setup-kerberos-windows-authentication) is also ensured. [Kerberos authentication can also be done access Ubuntu, CentOS, and RHEL](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-to-setup-kerberos-on-ubuntu-rhel-centos), protecting against unauthorized access and impersonation threats. You can also configure [Kerberos/NTLM SSO with Apache on Windows](https://plugins.miniorange.com/steps-to-setup-ntlm-sso-with-apache-on-windows).

**Benefits of Kerberos Authentication Protocol**

<strong>Secure Authentication</strong>: Strong cryptography ensures safe access to systems and resources.
<strong>Mutual Authentication</strong>: Verifies both client and server identities to prevent impersonation.
<strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Supports diverse operating systems and applications for broad SSO adoption.

It maps directory attributes to WordPress user-profiles and lets administrators assign WordPress roles to LDAP/Active Directory users, ensuring seamless integration.

=Which LDAP directories are supported?=
The plugin supports a wide range of directories, including Microsoft Active Directory, Azure AD, Sun AD, OpenLDAP, JumpCloud, FreeIPA, Synology, OpenDS, and many more. This makes it highly versatile for various directory environments.

=What is role mapping in this plugin?=
Role mapping assigns WordPress roles to LDAP/Active Directory users based on their group memberships or Organizational Units (OUs). This feature ensures users are automatically assigned proper roles after authentication based on their directory information.

=Does the plugin support Single Sign-On (SSO)?=
Yes, the plugin supports Kerberos/NTLM Single Sign-On (SSO) for domain-joined machines, allowing users to log into WordPress seamlessly without needing to enter their credentials again, provided they are authenticated in Active Directory.

=What is the authentication report feature?=
The authentication report logs failed login attempts from Active Directory/LDAP users, which can help identify potential security risks. Administrators can also export these reports in CSV format for further analysis or record-keeping.

=Can I authenticate users from multiple LDAP directories?=
Yes, the premium version supports authentication from multiple LDAP directories and search bases. Administrators can configure multiple directories and set up sequential searches or domain membership-based authentication to support complex directory setups.

=Is the plugin compatible with multisite WordPress environments?=
Yes, the premium version fully supports WordPress multisite environments, allowing administrators to configure LDAP/Active Directory login integration across multiple sites, and providing centralized authentication management for all subsites within a WordPress network.

=Are Active Directory passwords stored in the WordPress database?=
No, we do not store Active Directory passwords in WordPress due to security reasons. 

=How can Active Directory be used as an LDAP server?=
Active Directory inherently supports LDAP as a directory service. To use Active Directory as an LDAP server, you can connect applications or systems using the LDAP protocol for tasks such as authentication, querying users or groups, and managing directory information. Ensure that the correct LDAP ports (usually 389 for standard LDAP or 636 for LDAP over SSL) are open and that your application is configured to communicate with AD using these protocols.

=Does the plugin provide profile mapping and group mapping features?=
Yes, the plugin provides AD profile mapping as well as group mapping features that help in syncing user profiles as well as groups between LDAP/Active Directory and WordPress.
